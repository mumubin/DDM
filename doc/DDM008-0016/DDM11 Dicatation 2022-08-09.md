ELAINE: Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!

> JERRY: Why not? they could ~~match~~（'ve met). She loves the park. He works for the Parks Department.

> ELAINE: Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But,george (didn't )even ~~not in a~~(have his) glasses (on)!

JERRY: But he was squinting.

> ELAINE: So what? squinting doesn't make ~~some~~(much of a) difference ~~on it .~~

> JERRY: Are you kidding? I've seen him squint. ~~you can squint with double 20 .~~*he can squint his way down to like 20/30 vision
Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his
glasses. He squinted his way from Wurtsboro down to the
Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons on the road!

DOCTOR: Okay.

> ELAINE: Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot? 

DOCTOR: no shot, dog bite.

ELAINE: No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?

> DOCTOR: Not shot; dog bite. ~~wuf wuf, no bian bian.~~(woof-woof,not bang bang )


Jerry's apartment

JERRY: I was an idiot for listening to you!

GEORGE: Hey, I saw what I saw.

> JERRY: Oh, everything was going so well.
~~hani is a floss in need.~~(She hadn't seen any flaws in me.)
Now she is a side.

GEORGE: what's side?

> JERRY: ~~aminal~~(a bad site,an ugly ) side.


GEORGE: Ooh, so what?

JERRY: So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.

GEORGE: why don't you just ask Jeffrey?

> JERRY: Ah, ~~you are just naive .~~(he'd just deny it)

GEORGE: There must be some way to find out.

JERRY: Amy said nothing happened.

GEORGE: What, you ~~can take heart from~~(are gonna take her word over) mine? I'm your best friend!

JERRY: Yeah, ~~never mind~~(but) you are  ~~a~~ blind (as a bat)!

GEORGE: I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wurtsboro?
(snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.

> JERRY: They were mailboxes, you idiot.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐ ~~we are hard~~(I didn't have the heart) to tell u .

> GEORGE: (noticing something) Hey look, a dime . 
        (George walks over to the other end of the room and picks it up) Huh,
      mercury ~~hat~~(head). ~~remind~~ you mind ?

> JERRY: (Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters) Hey what happened to you? ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐ ~~we've seen  about 1~~ (you buzzed) 5 minutes ago .

> ELAINE: There was a dog in front of the building and ~~spoof~~(spooked ) to me. I couldn't come in until he left.

JERRY: A little white dog?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?

ELAINE: I'm afraid of dogs now.

JERRY: He's like a squirrel

ELAINE: Well, it frighten(ed) me .

GEORGE: Did you get the shot?

ELAINE: No. He said I didn't need a shot.

GEORGE: You got bit by a strange dog, you didn't get a (rabies) shot,are you sure ?

ELAINE: Why, you think I should have? (George indicates 'yes')

JERRY: You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.

ELAINE: All right, that's a good idea. I will do that
. (Kramer enters) 

KRAMER: The A/C is on its way.
  
GEORGE: Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne—there was no discount.

KRAMER: What?

GEORGE: That's right, no discount!

KRAMER: Well did you mention my name?

GEORGE: Yes, I mentioned your name.
 
KRAMER: And?

GEORGE: Pfft! Bupkis!

KRAMER: Now I don't believe this. that guy owes me big time . I got him off sugar! Alright, look, I'm
gonna go down there with you right now. Come on.

> GEORGE: All right, ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐let me just... (I'm gonna) grab an apple .

JERRY: Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!

KRAMER: Little Snowball? He runs on batteries! (George takes a bite out of an onion)

ELAINE: You know, George, that's an onion.

GEORGE: Yes, it is. (he takes another bite)

ELAINE: He couldn't tell an apple from an onion and he's your eye witness?

GEORGE: I saw them making out, you can believe it.

JERRY: I don't know what to believe! You're eating onions.
You’re spotting dimes. I don't know what the hell is going on.

KRAMER: Look, all you gotta do is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.

> JERRY: Hey wait a second, wait a second. 
I am going to the Jeffrey's ~~party~~(apartment) tomorrow night
~~because this is whole femanticed~~(to pick up these Paul Simon tickets.) and I ~~look surprise at~~(am gonna surprise) Amy.
. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And
then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.

KRAMER: Right this way, Mr. Doody!

GEORGE: (crying from the onion) you'll see, I am right.
