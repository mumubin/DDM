## DDM 02

I am an artist based ~~on~~(in) New York.

And I am working on a project called (the) Bay (of) lights.

Which is ~~considers as~~(consists of) a light sculpture.

which's just have 25000 (white) LED lights. 

Which (we) are ~~touching the spend table~~ (attaching to the suspender cables) of Bay bridge.

And It's 1.8 mile ~~spreads~~ (expanse of) bridge between San Francisco and Treasure island.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️It's highlighting a ~~propart~~(part) of bridge ~~and so the people of structure~~(of this incredible piece of infrastructure) ~~meaning some of~~(that's so meaningful to so many) people (here  ) in the Bay area.

But it's bringing art light technology into the ~~max~~(mix).

And  the other thing, u know, it's a ~~sacks pacific~~ site-specific.

It ~~makes suficien~~ specifically for the location 

So I have (been) sitting around here for over (a )month~~s~~ . working on the sequencing ~~for~~ (and) the  programs fine tuning (it).

It is (an )abstract ~~an~~ art work.   It's not a light show.


It's something kind of new. ~~And~~ (In that) It's using many of new material. software and LEDs,


people are attracted to light. (and) I think ~~those~~(they'll) respond in whatever way.

~~That's we~~(if they) know, ~~It rewards a~~ (something of the history of art ) light sculpture.  ~~It have been in the that~~ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  They might be into that 

, technology, algorithms u know programing, so I think it ~~won't~~(will) touch on a lot of things (that are kind) of ~~the~~ key of (the) bay area

we ~~are~~(have been) testing and debugging, so everyone can watch the progress for several weeks now.  

but we are launching ~~some~~ this piece~~s~~ ~~of  art fiece~~(on March 5th) at 9 o'clock , and there will be a lot of jubilation

~~and~~ (when it's) finally up, it ~~last~~ (will be) up ~~to~~(for)  2 years. 

~~It is ready for 49~~(⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐And we're estimating 50 million) people to see it. It is really a ~~in pack~~ (really impactful piece) for public ~~ar~~(art)
