In the spring of 1939, ~~boost~~(during the buildup to) a war with Germany,


The British government ~~committed~~(commissioned)  a ~~serious~~(serial) propganda posters (These posters were intended to offer the public reassurance in the dark days that lay ahead)

~~recommand the public reassure the dark days,they had~~

They ~~will be~~（were) required to uniform in ~~star~~(style) and ~~the~~(were to) feature (a) special handsome ~~time face~~(typeface).

~~Which will be~~(making them) difficult (for the enemy to counterfeit), they use(d) the ~~criminal advice~~(crown of King George VI as the only graphic device that had), ~~and~~ just two colors

Of (the) three final (designs that went into) productions. the first poster ~~with~~(carried) the slogan , your courage ,your cheerfulness, your resolution will bring (us) victory

the seconder poster had the words  , freedom ~~depend all of ur own mind~~(is in Peril; Defend it with All Your Might.”).

(But)the third  design, ~~has more t han 25~~(of which over two and a half million posters) ~~half million~~(were) printed , simply read. keep calm and carry on.

The first ~~to~~(two) design(s) ~~to~~(were) distribute(d) in 9 (of) 1939,(appeared up and)down ~~to~~ the country (in shop)~~, shadow on the~~ windows and railway platforms 

but ~~it~~(the) keep calm ~~help themselves~~(were hold in reserve) ;~~and it used only months to cross the provision.~~ intended for use only in times of crisis or invasion.
~~and the end are never afishily,~~

(in the end, the poster was never officially issued and it remained unseen by the)~~It reminder~~ public until (a copy turned up more than) 50 years later.


It ~~sounds the~~(was found in a)  second hands ~~in the corner vi.\~~(bookshop called Barter Books in the northeast corner of England)

~~But build begin~~(Barter Books was begun) in the 1991,  by a couple of ~~executed by Mars and Mary~~(Stewart and Mary Manley).
The building ~~is a~~(used to be an) old ~~victory~~(Victorian) railway station.

Huge (rows of stack shelves now stand in the place where the tracks would have been)

(but )the station ~~is a~~('s old) tearooms and waiting rooms are still here,


it was (in) 2000 (that stewart)found ~~books~~(poster) in ~~the dust option~~ a box of dusty. (old books that had been bought at auction.)

~~mary like to show much, a year later,they began to start to copy.~~ 

(Mary liked it so much, she had it framed and put it up near the shop till. 

And it proved so popular with the customers that a year later they began to sell copies.))

since that time,(the poster has been) reproduced and ~~parity~~(parodied and trivialized and has ) become ~~acharming in~~(a truly iconic image of) 21st century.

It is hard to say that exactly ~~what~~(why) such a ~~free~~(phrase from a bygone) ~~to~~ decade ~~from the renaissance now.~~ (would have so much appeal and resonance)

(Its design’s considered simple and timeless and now commonly recognizable.)

~~It designs to a simply time and recommadtion as for. whoever had pass~~ 
(However, it is perhaps the words on the poster that people find most enchanting. Like a voice out of history,)

~~I can voiced  It would be a very hot and conference go times and someone fish~~
(it offers a very simple, warm-hearted message to inspire confidence in others during difficult times. And it’s something that should never fade from fashion—)

To keep calm and carry on.
